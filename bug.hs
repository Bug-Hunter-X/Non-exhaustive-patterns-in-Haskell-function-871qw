This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a Maybe type, but fails to handle the `Nothing` case, leading to a runtime error.

```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
```

The problem is that if the input is `Nothing`, the pattern match fails, resulting in a `Non-exhaustive patterns` error at compile time.
